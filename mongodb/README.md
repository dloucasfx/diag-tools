
# MongoDB Connection Test
This docker image is used to test customer's connection to MongoDB; using the specific version of pymongo the smart agent uses.

You can run the script directly, without docker, as long as you have the pymongo package installed (example: run it in the same place where the agent is running)

## Build
Run the below to build the image
```
docker build -t <repo/name:tag> .
```

## Run
`--net host` is only needed if mongodb is installed on the same docker host and you are trying to access it through localhost

```
docker run -it --net host <repo/name:tag>
```

## Examples

#### Successful Run:
```
prompt$ docker run -it --net host dlouca/mongotest:latest
Enter mongoDB host: localhost
Enter mongoDB port: 27017
{u'ismaster': True, u'maxWriteBatchSize': 100000, u'ok': 1.0, u'maxWireVersion': 8, u'connectionId': 8, u'readOnly': False, u'localTime': datetime.datetime(2020, 2, 25, 18, 31, 14, 76000), u'minWireVersion': 0, u'maxBsonObjectSize': 16777216, u'maxMessageSizeBytes': 48000000, u'logicalSessionTimeoutMinutes': 30}
```

#### Failed Run:
```
prompt$ docker run -it --net host dlouca/mongotest:latest
Enter mongoDB host: saassa
Enter mongoDB port: 12334

## Additional Options:

You can pass additional options as environmental variables.
Currently, only `ssl_ca_certs` is supported.

example using docker:
```
docker run -it --net host -v /path/to/your/local/ca.pem:/test/ca.pem --env ssl_ca_certs=/test/ca.pem dlouca/mongotest:latest bash
```
